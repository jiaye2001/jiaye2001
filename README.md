# 👋 Hi, I’m Jiaye Lee!

🎓 I'm a Master's student in Information Systems at Northeastern University, passionate about **full-stack web development** and building secure, scalable applications.

💻 My recent projects focus on modern web development with clean architecture, responsive design, and real-time features:

- 💬 **Chat SPA (2025)**  
  A secure, real-time messaging app built from scratch as a single-page application using vanilla JavaScript and RESTful APIs.  
  Features session-based authentication, user tracking, and efficient polling architecture.

- 🧠 **LEXA Chatbot**  
  A modular Java-based chatbot framework for desktop systems, powered by Gemini API and custom data structures for intelligent Q&A and ranking.

- 🛡️ **Network Security Architecture Design**  
  Designed enterprise-level security infrastructure including IDS, DNS security, and firewall integration – reinforcing my backend systems with a strong security mindset.
